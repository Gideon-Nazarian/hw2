### Programming Problem Notes

 For each programming problem, let us know:

//How we should compile your code (`g++` command or `make` target):
 
 - use make to compile code and ./amazon NAMEOFDATABASE.txt to run
 

// Design decisions you made or other non-trivial choices for your implementation
 - none


 //Any additional tests you wrote and what files those exist in
 -none


//Known errors/anything to help us grade (though we will run automated tests,
knowing what features may be broken/missing may help us provide some partial credit):
- none that I know of but using commands properly should yield results requested. Commands must be displayed like menu, (meaning first word must be all caps
- then rest is whatever it requests)
